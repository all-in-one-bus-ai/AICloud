For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

When using client-side hooks (useState and useEffect) in a component that's being treated as a Server Component by Next.js, always add the "use client" directive at the top of the file.

Do not write code that will trigger this error: "Warning: Extra attributes from the server: %s%s""class,style"

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, the shadcn/ui library, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.

IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS
1) Do not redesign everything unless told to do so. Extend current UI style, sidebar, cards, and layout.
2) Every feature must be multi-tenant and role-based (owner/manager/cashier/superadmin).
3) Make modules OPTIONAL via tenant feature flags (add-on toggles). If disabled, hide UI and block routes.
4) Keep “core POS” fast; heavy features should be separate pages/modules.
5) Use Supabase Postgres + RLS everywhere.
6) Add audit logging for key actions across modules.
